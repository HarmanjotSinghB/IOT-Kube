# IOT-Kube

## Overview

This project leverages Kubernetes to manage, scale, and orchestrate containerized applications. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of core Kubernetes concepts, networking, resource management, storage, security, advanced features, deployment strategies, ecosystem tools, and additional concepts essential for this project.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A pod represents a single instance of an application, typically containing one or more containers.
- **Containers**: A standardized unit of software that packages code and its dependencies. Containers are lightweight and portable, allowing for consistent execution across different environments.
- **Namespaces**: Virtualized environments within a Kubernetes cluster that isolate resources and users. Each namespace is a logical grouping of resources like pods, deployments, and services.
- **Deployments**: Manage the lifecycle of a set of pods, ensuring that the desired number of replicas are running and available. Deployments allow for rolling updates and automated rollbacks.
- **Services**: Abstract the location of pods and provide a stable endpoint for accessing them. Services enable communication between pods and external applications.
- **Replication Controllers**: (Older, but still used in some cases) Manage the desired number of replicas for a specific pod template.
- **StatefulSets**: Deploy and manage stateful applications with persistent storage and unique identities.
- **DaemonSets**: Ensure that a pod runs on every node in the cluster. Useful for system-level tasks or agents that need to be present on each node.
- **Jobs**: Run temporary tasks (e.g., batch processing) that complete once the task is finished.
- **CronJobs**: Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals, enabling recurring tasks.
- **ConfigMaps**: Store configuration data for applications as key-value pairs.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates, in a secure way.
- **Ingress**: Exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
- **Node**: A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster that runs pods.

## Networking

- **Kubernetes Network Model**: Defines how pods communicate with each other and with external systems.
- **ClusterIP Service**: Internal service accessible only within the cluster.
- **NodePort Service**: Exposes the service on a specific port on each node.
- **LoadBalancer Service**: Uses cloud provider load balancers to expose the service externally.
- **NetworkPolicy**: Controls network traffic between pods and services.
- **CNI (Container Network Interface)**: Provides a standard way for containers to connect to the network.

---

## Resource Management

- **Resource Limits and Requests**: Specify resource requirements for pods, ensuring that they receive the resources they need to run optimally.
- **Resource Quotas**: Enforce limits on the amount of resources (CPU, memory) that can be used by specific namespaces.
- **Resource Monitoring and Metrics**: Tools to track resource usage and identify potential issues.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Scales the number of pods up or down automatically based on resource utilization or other metrics.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**: Adjusts the resource limits and requests for pods based on their resource usage patterns.

---

## Storage

- **PersistentVolume (PV)**: A piece of storage that is available to the cluster.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: A request for storage by a pod.
- **StorageClasses**: Define the types of storage available in the cluster and their characteristics (e.g., performance, cost).
- **VolumeMount**: Attaches a volume to a container within a pod.
- **HostPath**: Volumes that use local storage on the node where the pod is running.
- **EmptyDir**: Ephemeral volumes that are created when a pod starts and deleted when it stops.

---

## Security

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Controls access to Kubernetes resources based on roles and permissions.
- **Pod Security Policies (PSP)**: Enforces security policies on pods, limiting what they can do and access.
- **Admission Controllers**: Intercepts API requests to enforce security or validation policies.
- **Network Security**: Use network policies and other security features to restrict network access between pods.

---

## Advanced Concepts

- **Service Mesh**: A dedicated layer for managing communication between microservices.
- **Istio**: A popular open-source service mesh platform.
- **Kubernetes Operators**: Extend the capabilities of Kubernetes by automating common tasks.
- **Custom Resources Definitions (CRD)**: Define new resource types that extend the Kubernetes API.
- **Helm**: A package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying the installation and management of applications.
- **Kustomize**: A tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations.
- **Kubectl**: The command-line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

---

## Deployment Strategies

- **Rolling Update**: Gradually replaces old pods with new ones, minimizing downtime.
- **Recreate**: Stops all pods and then creates new ones.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploys a new version of the application in a separate environment and then switches traffic to the new version.
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolls out a new version of the application to a small subset of users before releasing it to everyone.

---

## Kubernetes Ecosystem

- **Minikube**: A local Kubernetes environment for development and testing.
- **Rancher**: A container management platform that simplifies Kubernetes deployments and management.
- **OpenShift**: A Red Hat-based enterprise Kubernetes platform.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: A fully managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud Platform.
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: A fully managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A fully managed Kubernetes service on Azure.

## Additional Concepts

- **Quota**: In Kubernetes, quotas are a resource management tool used to limit the amount of resources (like CPU, memory, storage, and even pods) that can be consumed by a specific namespace. This is a way to manage the cluster's resources and prevent any one application or user from overwhelming the cluster.
- **Gateway API**: A Kubernetes API that provides a standard way for defining and managing network gateways for your cluster. It offers a more consistent and robust way to create and manage ingress controllers and other network components compared to using custom solutions.
- **Affinity**: Affinity in Kubernetes refers to rules that control where pods are scheduled in the cluster. It allows you to influence the placement of pods based on specific criteria. There are two main types of affinity:
  - **Node Affinity**: Specifies preferences for the nodes where pods should be scheduled.
  - **Pod Affinity/Anti-affinity**: Specifies preferences for the co-location (affinity) or separation (anti-affinity) of pods.
- **StatefulSet**: A Kubernetes resource that ensures that pods are deployed and managed in a way that preserves their identity and state. This is crucial for applications that require persistent storage, unique network identities, or specific ordering for their pods.
- **Redis containers/pods**: Redis is a popular in-memory data store often used as a cache or message broker. In Kubernetes, Redis is typically deployed as a pod or a set of pods running Redis containers.
- **Sidecar**: A sidecar container is a companion container that runs alongside the main application container in a pod. Sidecars are often used to provide additional functionality to the main container, such as logging, monitoring, security, or providing access to specific services.

## Rollbacks

- **Versioning**: To implement rollbacks, you'll need a way to track different versions of your application deployments. This can be done using:
  - **Deployment Strategies**: Kubernetes Deployments allow you to define a deployment strategy like "Rolling Update." The deployment history will retain previous versions, allowing you to roll back to a specific version using `kubectl rollout undo <deploymentName>`.
  - **Image Tagging**: You can tag Docker images with version numbers (e.g., `my-app:v1`, `my-app:v2`, etc.), which allows you to specify the desired version in your Kubernetes YAML configuration.
  - **Deployment History**: Kubernetes Deployments track the history of revisions, making rollbacks easier. Use `kubectl rollout history <deploymentName>` to view the deployment history.

## Additional Concepts

### Resource Limits and Requests
- **Resource Limits**: Define the maximum amount of CPU and memory that a pod can consume, preventing any single pod from monopolizing resources and affecting others.
- **Resource Requests**: Specify the minimum amount of CPU and memory that a pod needs to function properly. Kubernetes attempts to allocate these requested resources to your pods.

### LoadBalancer
- **Service Type**: In Kubernetes, LoadBalancers are a service type that allows external access to your pods, typically using a cloud provider's load balancing service.
- **Use Cases**: Expose your application externally, distribute traffic across multiple pods for availability, and provide load balancing for performance improvements.

### NetworkPolicy
- **Purpose**: NetworkPolicies control the flow of network traffic between pods and services within a Kubernetes cluster. They enforce isolation and security by defining rules for which pods can communicate with each other.
- **Use Cases**: Restrict access between pods, isolate sensitive data, and prevent malicious traffic from entering your cluster.

### Ingress
- **Purpose**: Ingress resources expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. They direct traffic to the appropriate services based on defined rules.
- **Use Cases**: Route incoming traffic to different services, manage SSL certificates, provide load balancing, and enable A/B testing.

### NodePort
- **Service Type**: NodePort Services expose the service on a specific port on each node in the cluster. This allows access to the service from outside the cluster using the node's IP address and the assigned NodePort.
- **Use Cases**: Provide a straightforward way to expose services without using a LoadBalancer, useful in testing and development environments.

### ConfigMaps
- **Purpose**: ConfigMaps store configuration data for applications in a key-value format.
- **Similar to Env Files**: Yes, ConfigMaps can store data similar to environment variables in a `.env` file, but provide a more integrated way to manage this data within Kubernetes. They can be mounted as volumes into containers and referenced directly in application code.

### Resource Properties
In Kubernetes, resource properties refer to the specific resources that a pod requires, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

## Health Checks

- **Liveness Probes**: Check if a container is running and responsive. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- **Readiness Probes**: Check if a container is ready to receive traffic. If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes does not route traffic to the pod.

## Additional Concepts Hands-on

### Resource Limits and Requests
1. Create a deployment with limits and requests defined in the pod template.
2. Monitor resource usage with `kubectl top pods` or a monitoring tool like Prometheus/Grafana.

### LoadBalancer
1. Create a LoadBalancer service for your application deployment.
2. Test access to your application using the load balancer's external IP address.

### NetworkPolicy
1. Create a NetworkPolicy that restricts network traffic from pods in one namespace to pods in another namespace.
2. Test connectivity to ensure the policy is working as expected.

### ConfigMaps
1. Create a ConfigMap for Redis credentials.
2. Mount the ConfigMap as a volume to your Redis container.

### Probes
1. Implement Liveness, Readiness, and Startup probes for your Redis container.
2. Use `kubectl describe pod` to monitor probe results.

## Kubernetes Dashboard and Rollback Access

- **User Access Control (RBAC)**: Kubernetes provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Custom roles can be created to allow specific users to execute `kubectl rollout undo` commands but restrict other actions like creating or deleting deployments.
- **EKS Integration**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) provides a built-in dashboard that you can configure with RBAC. This simplifies user access management and allows for rollbacks.
- **Visibility in Dashboard**: The EKS dashboard, like other Kubernetes dashboards, typically displays deployment history, allowing developers to select a previous revision for rollbacks.
